Founded by serial entrepreneurs, Celo is a new company aiming to remove the barriers for large-scale adoption of
cryptocurrencies as means-of-payment. Using a novel address-based encryption algorithm, Celo makes sending money as easy
as sending a text. Additionally, Celo uses stable-value tokens pegged to fiat currencies, like the US Dollar, to
minimize volatility. Anyone can participate in the network and earn Celo currency, even with just a budget Android
smartphone. The first application launching on our platform is a social payments and money transfer app, aimed at
developing markets.

Investors: a16z, Polychain, General Catalyst, Coinbase, Reid Hoffman and Jack Dorsey, among others.
