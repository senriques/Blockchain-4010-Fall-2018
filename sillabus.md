Title IX – Duty to Report
----------------------------
 
The University of Wyoming faculty are committed to helping create a safe learning environment for all students and for
the university as a whole. If you have experienced any form of gender or sex-based discrimination or harassment,
including sexual assault, sexual harassment, relationship violence, or stalking, know that help and support are
available. The University has staff members trained to support survivors in navigating campus life, accessing health and
counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, and more. The University strongly encourages all
students to report any such incidents to the University. Please be aware that all University of Wyoming employees,
including student staff, are required to report all Title IX related concerns to the Title IX Coordinator or their
supervisor. This means that if you tell a faculty member about a situation of sexual harassment or sexual violence, or
other related misconduct, the faculty member must share that information with the University’s Title IX Coordinator.
UW’s Title IX Coordinator is Jim Osborn (Manager of Investigations, Equal Opportunity Report and Response). He is
located in Room 320 of the Bureau of Mines Building, and can be reached via email at report-it@uwyo.edu or via phone at
766-5200 or 766-5228. For more information, go to:
