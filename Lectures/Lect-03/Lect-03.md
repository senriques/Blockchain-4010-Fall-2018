More On Go
====================

"It is not the strongest of the species that survies, nor the most intelligent.
It is the one that is the most adaptable to change."
	Charles Darwin

1st. the news
-----------------

1. AU - Research - linear scaling (similar to blockchain) 8000 tx per sec, don't specify latency.
2. Java 4th garbage collector - tried it.  Provision at 20% before, now at 25% ok, at 30% boom.
3. Did everybody in the class get a "key".
4. California bill passed that defines things like "digital signature".



2nd. Purpose of a business
-------------------------

To make a profit for the owners of the business.

What is "Fiduciary Responsibility".  It means that you have been placed / are in a
position of legal responsibility for managing somebody else's money.



Go
-----------------

1. Functions

Parts of a function

```
	// Name will do a b c d.
	func Name ( i1 Type1, i2 Type2 ) ( o1 Type1, o2 Type2 ) {
		// Comment in body
	}
```

Observations
	1. Name starts with a capital, therefore exported from package.
	2. You can have more than 1 return value.
	3. "error" is usually the last return value.
	4. Comments on functions need to start with the name of the function.


2. Maps

Go has dictionary/maps

```
	var m1 map[string]int
	m1 = make(map[string]int)
	m1["abc"] = 12
	k := m1["abc"]
	k2 := m1["xyz"]
	k3, ok_t := m1["abc"]
	k4, ok_f := m1["xyz"]
```

Observations
	1. memory is not allocated to a map when it is declared.
	2. You can just use `make` and `:=` to declare a map.
	3. You can test to see if you have an un-allocated map by comparing to `nil`.
	4. You can find out if a value is in a map.

3. Slices (Arrays)

An Array

```
	var a1 [4]int
```

A slice

```
	var s1 []int
```

What is a slice?


4. io & cli

Output:

```
	fmt.Printf ( "Format %s\n", "string" )
```

CLI

```
	fmt.Printf ( "%s\n", os.Args[] )
```
