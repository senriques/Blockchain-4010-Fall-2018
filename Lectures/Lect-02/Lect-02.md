Ability to create trust between non-trusting parties.
Ability to create economic systems.

Merick - shipping 40% decrease in shipping times.  World wide $380 Billion in trade.  90% of all the goods
in the world are moved by ship.  38 days average shipping time. A 40% reduction is dropping that to 23 days.
Difference is 15 days.  40% of 380 billion is 152 billion in capital that is not tied up - at an average
capital cost of 10% = 15.2 billion - over the 23 days.  15/365 * 15.2 billion. -- About 0.62 billion.

Estonia - All titles and property on the chain.  In US 5.51 Million Houses.  Average title search $3821.
