### Lecture 00 - Aug 29 - Wednesday - Class Overview

1. A little bit of background on the instructor
	1. pschlump@uwyo.edu
	1. https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/Blockchain-4010-Fall-2018
	2. (for emergencies between 7:00AM and 9:00PM) 720-209-7888 (cell) 
	3. This is a "practical" class.
	4. Class Goal - have every student in this class be able to work effectively
		in the Blockchain/Ethereum world.   There are students in this class
		that are from other departments.  The class has been structured to 
		take this into account.
	5. Where the students are and the opportunity they have today.
	6. Realizing Your Dreams.

2. Class policy - UW requires that I talk about cheating.
	stackoverflow.com and Google are your fiends in this class - give credit where
	credit is due.  warning: stackoverflow.com on ethereum/solidity
	is badly out of date becuse the technology is changing really fast.
	If you copy from the web - I expect a comment and a link (URL) to the
	source of where you got your copy.  I expect an explanation of what and 
	why you are grabbing someting from the web.  I expect an analysis of
	what license the content is under, MIT, GPL2, GPL3, CC, CC-BY etc.
	
3. Late Policy and (3) Late Coupons
	I have a grader - most of the grading will be automated.  You get
 	3 late coupons - I will send them to you in email.  You can use
	them for handing in homework 1 week after the due date.  Late 
	coupons will be tracked on a semi-private Ethereum Blockchian
	with a Smart Contract.	

	Application: http://www.2c-why.com/UW-dApp/

4. 70% from homework, 40% from tests.  Midterm and Final.
	There will be 2 projects for the class.
	You will have to give a live, in person, demo of both of your projects
	and you **must** get them to work.  They are required to
	pass the class.

5. Class Points Total

	Points available:

	| Points            | Class Item         |
	|------------------:|--------------------|
	| 1400              | Homework total     |
	|  800              | 2 tests            |

	To get a letter grade in the class:

	| Points            | Semester Grade     |
	| ----------------- | ------------------ |
	| 1900 or above     | A+                 |
	| 1800 ... 1899     | A                  |
	| 1600 ... 1799     | B                  |
	| 1400 ... 1599     | C                  |
	| 1200 ... 1399     | D                  |
	
	You **must** demonstrate working projects to the instructor to pass the class (no matter how many points you get).
	The 2 projects in the class will be directly from the homework.  Project one is Homework Assignments 02 to 06.
	Project 2 is Homework Assignments 08 to 11.  Homework will be 100 or 200 points each.   Midterm will be 400 points.
	Final will be 400 points and cumulative.  You can expect programming and writen assignments in this class.

	For anybody that just wants to take on a hard project for extra credit see the instructor.  It is hard.
	So think a letter grade for completion of an extra credit project.  Code for extra credit projects will
	be open source under a MIT license.   Also note that there are 2200 points available on a letter grading
	scale of 2000 points.   You have a built-in 200 point extra credit in the homework and tests.

5. textbook: [An Introduction to Programming in Go, pdf for free](https://www.golang-book.com/public/pdf/gobook.0.pdf)
	There are no good books on Ethereum/Soliddity.  Solidity has moved from version 4.12 to 4.27 this year.
	All of the books are out of date.  So.... I will include links in assignments that you are expected to
	read.

6. Class Overview

	2. The worlds worst, most expensive database
	3. What is the "hype" - what is real.
	4. Economics - Coin, ICO, Stocks Bonds, Tokens, Utility Tokens
	5. Legal Ramifications.  ICOs 506(d), Subpart (s)

	14. Why Ethereum? Solidity?
	15. dApp - what is that?  What is web3?
	16. A detailed understanding of the security model behind Blockchain
	17. Some advanced stuff on security - distributed computation and public/private keys, distributed key generation.
