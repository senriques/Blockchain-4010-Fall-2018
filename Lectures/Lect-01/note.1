-- get size of screen for full screen
I think that's the point. Your main process is just that, it manages all of your rendered html, new windows..

So:

`
//my main.js
const electron = require('electron')
const {app, BrowserWindow} = electron

let win

app.on('ready', () => {
const {width, height} = electron.screen.getPrimaryDisplay().workAreaSize
win = new BrowserWindow({width, height, backgroundColor: '#6BD3AB'})
win.loadURL(file://${__dirname}/render/index.html)
})`

When I run my application, my app looks like file://${__dirname}/render/index.html in my case.

Gramoli, who heads the Concurrent Systems Research Group developing the blockchain, says trials over the past three
months showed the technology’s performance gets better as it scales up.
