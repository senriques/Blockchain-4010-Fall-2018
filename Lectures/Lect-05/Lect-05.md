Lecture 5 - More on Mining, Go Interfaces and Go Weaknesses

Detailed walk through of mining.

Go Interfaces
------------------------------

Go Weaknesses
------------------------------

What are the limitations of using Go

1. No objects - Use interfaces instead.  No inheritance.
2. No generics - Use templates and code instead.
3. No error handling - Just return errors.

Go 2.0 is coming in 1.5 years.  Go's design team commitment
is 100% backward compatibility - it will be able to correctly
compile go 1.0 code without change to the language.
