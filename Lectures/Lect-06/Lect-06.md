Merkle Trees
=======================

I thought that I would do Merkle trees in this lecture.  But we are going to do an overview of transactions instead.  Merkle trees
are used to validate that a set of transactions has not changed - and that the data is real.  Let's start with the reason for
using the Merkle trees first.  Then on Monday we will get to the Merkle trees.

So...

This is the stuff that I was going to start on Monday - I have just swapped the order a little bit.

Merkle trees is assignment 3, due Sep 26 - so swapping lectures will not have any adverse effect.

Lat time we talked about blocks and a blockchain.  Lot's of Go stuff - interfaces... Stuff like that.

Today Let's get into the nitty-gritty of Blocks and Transactions.  This is what bitcoin is all about.
This is the "distributed ledger".
