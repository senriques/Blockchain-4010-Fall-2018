<h1>What is Mining?</h1>

<p>At the root of our blockchain is a special block called a &ldquo;genesis&rdquo; block.<br />
Basically the &ldquo;genesis&rdquo; block is the beginning block in our block chain.  It is
special because it will not point back to any previous block.</p>

<p>The code that you are given can write out the genesis block.</p>

<h3>Pseudo Code for the mining.</h3>

<p>In the file ./mine/mine.go, implment the function MineBlock.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use an infinite loop to:

<ol>
<li>Searilize the data from the block for hasing, Call block.SearilizeForSeal to do this.</li>
<li>Calculate the hash of the data, Call hash.HashOf to do this. This is the slow part.  What would happen if we
replaced the software with a hash calculator on a graphics card where you could run 4096 hahes at once?
What would happen if we replaced the graphics card with an ASIC - so you had dedicated hardware to do
the hash and you could run 4 billion hashes a second?</li>
<li>Convert the hash (it is []byte) to a hex string.  Use the hex.EncodeToString standard go library function.</li>
<li><code>fmt.Printf(&quot;((Mining)) Hash for Block [%s] nonce [%8d]\r&quot;, theHashAsAString, bk.Nonce)</code></li>
<li>See if the first 4 characters of the hash are 0&rsquo;s. - if so we have met the work criteria.
In go this is <code>if theHashAsAString[0:4] == &quot;0000&quot; {</code>.  This is create a slice, 4 long from
character 0 with length of 4, then compare that to the string <code>&quot;0000&quot;</code>.</li>
<li>Set the blcoks &ldquo;Seal&rdquo; to the hash</li>
<li><code>fmt.Printf(&quot;((Mining)) Hash for Block [%s] nonce [%8d]\n&quot;, theHashAsAString, bk.Nonce)</code></li>
<li>return</li>
<li>Increment the Nonce in the block, and&hellip;</li>
<li>Back to the top of the loop for another try at finding a seal for this block.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>In the ./mine directory there is a test.  Complete the MineBlock function.  Run the
test.</p>

<p>Submit your completed ./mine/mine.go file.</p>

<p>My output when running the test.</p>

<p>The grader has a somewhat more comprehensive automated test to run with this code (There is one more block
to mine).   You get all the points for the assignment when it passes the test.</p>
