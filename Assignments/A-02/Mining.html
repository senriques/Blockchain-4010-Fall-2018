<h1>What is Mining?</h1>

<p>In this assignment you will implement proof-of-work mining.  Before we get to the details on mining
let&rsquo;s start at the beginning of our blockchain.</p>

<p>At the root of our blockchain is a special block called the &ldquo;genesis&rdquo; block.  Basically the &ldquo;genesis&rdquo; block is the
beginning block in our blockchain. It is special because it will not point back to any previous block.</p>

<p>The code that you are given can write out the genesis block, and an index to where to find it. In most blockchains like
Bitcoin  some sort of a database is used for storing the blocks.</p>

<p>We are not going to do that. We are going to store all of them in files in the file system. This is so you can see the
blocks. Also we are going to store the blocks in JSON as text so you can read the blocks. Using a database is faster but
has lots of overhead. It can also be very frustrating when you are attempting to determine if the block is correct and
you can&rsquo;t easily see what is in the  block.</p>

<p>Our blocks will be written (by default) in the <code>./data</code> directory. The format for the blocks is <code>hash.json</code>, where hash
is the block hash.</p>

<p>To get started, first checkout the code for Assignment 2 - this can be done by: (You can go online to it and cut-paste
the link - that is what I usually do. In the browser go to
<a href="https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education">https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education</a>. Then click on the
<code>Blockchain-4010-Fall-2018</code> repository. When that comes up there is a green button on the left that says <code>Clone or
download</code>. Click on that. Cut and paste the URL.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">	cd ~/go/src/github.com/
	mkdir Univ-Wyo-Education
	cd Univ-Wyo-Education
	git clone https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/Blockchain-4010-Fall-2018.git
</code></pre>

<p>If you have already done this you should update your copy of the class
repository with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">	cd ~/go/src/github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/Blockchain-4010-Fall-2018
	git pull
</code></pre>

<p>Then change directory into assignment 2.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">	cd Assignments/A-02
</code></pre>

<p>Our starting code is in this directory.  Specifically we will want to
compile the main program.  It is in ./main.  Cd to that directory.
You shooed end up in:
<code>~/go/src/github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/Blockchain-4010-Fall-2018/Assignments/A-02</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">	cd ./main
	go build
</code></pre>

<p>Run main to create the genesis block and the initial index.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">	./main --create-genesis
</code></pre>

<p>This should create a directory with 2 files in it.  The default
is in the <code>./data</code> directory.  The files are:</p>

<pre><code>	136c53391115ab7ff717bd24e62dd0df2c270500d7194290169a83488022548e.json
	index.json
</code></pre>

<p>You should look at the contents of the 2 files. The one with the long name is our genesis block. The <code>index.json</code> is an
index that will allow us to find data blocks as we are building the this blockchain.</p>

<p>The code is missing the chunk that will do the block mining. The stubbed out function is in ./mine/mine.go. Your
assignment is to implement the body of the function. You will want to verify that it works by running</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">	go test
</code></pre>

<p>in the <code>./mine</code> directory.  If you run that now you should get <code>FAIL</code>
because you have not implemented it yet.</p>

<p>Take the time to go and poke through the code.  This code is the basis
for your mid-term project.  You are going to need to be familiar with
all of it.  Run all the tests.   If you have questions about it now is
the time to be asking them.</p>

<h2>Mining</h2>

<p>Mining is the process of doing some hard work that anybody can easily check to verify that
a digital seal has been put on a block.  The seals that we will use are hashes with special
properties.  In our case the property will be that the first 4 characters of the hex
string representation of the hash will need to be zeros.  &ldquo;0000&rdquo; at the beginning of
the hash.   To generate a hash with this pattern we will include a 64 bit integer in
the data.  Each time we hash the data if we do not get a hash with our special property
we will increment the integer and try again.  After enough increments we will stumble
upon a hash with the properly.</p>

<p>The difficulty is controlled by the number of 0&rsquo;s at the beginning of our hash.
If we want to increases the difficulty we can go to 00000 or 000000 zeros.  In
Bitcoin this difficulty automatically increases.  In Ethereum this difficulty is
set by group consensus.</p>

<h3>Pseudo Code for the mining.</h3>

<p>In the file ./mine/mine.go, implement the function MineBlock.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use an infinite loop to:

<ol>
<li>Serialize the data from the block for hashing, Call block.SearilizeForSeal to do this.</li>
<li>Calculate the hash of the data, Call hash.HashOf to do this. This is the slow part.  What would happen if we
replaced the software with a hash calculator on a graphics card where you could run 4096 hahes at once?
What would happen if we replaced the graphics card with an ASIC - so you had dedicated hardware to do
the hash and you could run 4 billion hashes a second?</li>
<li>Convert the hash (it is []byte) to a hex string.  Use the hex.EncodeToString standard go library function.</li>
<li><code>fmt.Printf(&quot;((Mining)) Hash for Block [%s] nonce [%8d]\r&quot;, theHashAsAString, bk.Nonce)</code></li>
<li>See if the first 4 characters of the hash are 0&rsquo;s. - if so we have met the work criteria.
In go this is <code>if theHashAsAString[0:4] == &quot;0000&quot; {</code>.  This is create a slice, 4 long from
character 0 with length of 4, then compare that to the string <code>&quot;0000&quot;</code>.</li>
<li>Set the block&rsquo;s &ldquo;Seal&rdquo; to the hash</li>
<li><code>fmt.Printf(&quot;((Mining)) Hash for Block [%s] nonce [%8d]\n&quot;, theHashAsAString, bk.Nonce)</code></li>
<li>return</li>
<li>Increment the Nonce in the block, and&hellip;</li>
<li>Back to the top of the loop for another try at finding a seal for this block.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>In the ./mine directory there is a test.  Implement the MineBlock function.  Run the
test.  Remove the <code>InstructorImplementationMineBlock(bk) // TODO: Replace this line with your code.</code>
Put your code in place of it.</p>

<p>Submit your completed ./mine/mine.go file.</p>

<p>My output when running the test.</p>

<pre><code>+&gt; go test

</code></pre>

<p>The grader has a somewhat more comprehensive automated test to run with this code (There is one more block
to mine).   You get all the points for the assignment when it passes the test.</p>

<h3>Before you submit your code!</h3>

<p>Use the go formatter on your code.  Either <code>goimports -w *.go</code> or setup your editor to run
goimpors every time you save a go file.  I have this setup in <code>vim</code>.  Other editors can
do this also.</p>

<p>Run <code>go vet</code> and <code>golint *.go</code> on it.  Fix any errors.</p>

<h3>Submit</h3>

<ol>
<li>mine.go</li>
<li>a copy of your output from running <code>go test</code> in the <code>./mine</code> directory.</li>
</ol>
