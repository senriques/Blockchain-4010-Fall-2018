Class Summary

0. Class Overview
	1. What is Blockchain / Bitcoin - why it is important. 

		In 2009, a person or group of people named Satoshi Nakamoto published “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
		System”. ... The Bitcoin design was revolutionary — it elegantly tied
		cryptography, game theory, and economics into a trustless solution to the double-spend problem, and introduced the world
		to the first “chain of blocks”, a censorship-resistant public ledger protected by proof-of-work.

		This is a big deal. Unlike traditional payments, Bitcoin transactions don’t rely on a trusted third-party. Anyone can
		connect to the network and transact, without fear of censorship. Satoshi’s work solved these problems, and founded the
		field of cryptoeconomics.

		In 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed a new cryptocurrency — Ethereum. Ethereum was Vitalik’s answer to Bitcoin’s
		poor scripting capabilities. Instead of focusing on financial transactions and their outputs, Ethereum transactions are
		about state: agreeing on a computed state, and transitioning from one state to the next.

		Each transaction in Ethereum includes a sender, recipient, funds, and data, similar enough to Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin,
		however, a recipient can be a user or a smart contract.

	2. Gartner group projects that 3% of the world economy will blockchain based in 10 years.  This is a compounded annual
		growth rate of 62.2%.

	3. Plan - do lectures in advance of when assignments are due on the material - give students time to do homework.
	   Mark what is going to be tested on.

	4. This class is not a "heavy" programming class.  Yes you will program - but not a huge amount.   Unlike a lot of
		computer science classes this class has a paper and will have test questions involving definitions.  We are
		going to cover some finance, accounting, economics and other topics - not just "how to build a better program".
		If you have a limited programming background I will work with you.
